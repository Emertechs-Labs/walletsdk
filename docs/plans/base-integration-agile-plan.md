# Base Integration Agile Development Plan

## Overview
This plan outlines an agile approach to ensure comprehensive Base (Coinbase's L2) wallet integration works fully in the walletsdk project. We'll use Scrum methodology with 2-week sprints, story points for estimation, and focus on implementing missing functionality while verifying existing integrations.

## Agile Processes
- **Backlog Grooming**: Weekly sessions to refine user stories and estimate points.
- **Sprint Planning**: At sprint start, select stories from backlog based on priority and capacity.
- **Daily Standups**: 15-minute daily check-ins on progress, blockers, and next steps.
- **Sprint Reviews**: End-of-sprint demos of completed work.
- **Retrospectives**: Identify improvements for next sprint.
- **Definition of Done**: Code reviewed, tested, documented, and merged to main branch.
