1. **Identify Components Needing Memoization**
   - `BalanceDisplay` - frequently updates
   - `TransactionHistory` - large data sets
   - `UnifiedConnectModal` - complex state

2. **Implement React.memo**
   ```typescript
   export const BalanceDisplay = React.memo(({ balance, symbol }: Props) => {
     // component logic
   });
   ```

3. **Add useMemo for Expensive Calculations**
   - Memoize computed values in components
   - Optimize hook dependencies

4. **Performance Testing**
   - Use React DevTools Profiler
   - Test on various devices/browsers

#### Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] React.memo added to all appropriate components
- [ ] useMemo used for expensive computations
- [ ] Performance benchmarks established
- [ ] No performance regressions

### 5. Dependency Management Enhancement
**Status:** Not Started
**Estimated Effort:** 1 week
**Owner:** DevOps/Development Team

#### Objectives
- Improve optional dependency handling
- Implement automated dependency updates
- Regular security vulnerability scanning

#### Implementation Steps
1. **Feature Detection for Optional Dependencies**
   ```typescript
   // Check if Firebase is available
   const isFirebaseAvailable = () => {
     try {
       require('firebase/app');
       return true;
     } catch {
       return false;
     }
   };
   ```

2. **Graceful Degradation**
   - Components that require Firebase should handle absence gracefully
   - Clear error messages when features unavailable

3. **Automated Updates**
   - Set up Dependabot or similar for PR-based updates
   - Regular npm audit checks in CI/CD

4. **Bundle Analysis**
   - Monitor bundle size impact of dependencies
   - Optimize imports (tree shaking)

#### Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Optional dependencies handled gracefully
- [ ] Automated dependency updates configured
- [ ] Security scanning in CI/CD pipeline
- [ ] Bundle size monitored and optimized
